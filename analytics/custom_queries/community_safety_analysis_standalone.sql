-- Community Safety and Real Estate Correlation Analysis
-- Standalone SQL version - Run directly in Snowflake
-- This analysis explores the relationship between crime rates, school safety, and real estate values

-- Step 1: Get the base community analytics data
with community_analytics as (
    select 
        community_area_name,
        community_area_number,
        per_capita_income,
        hardship_index,
        total_crime_incidents,
        avg_school_safety_score,
        avg_list_price,
        avg_sold_price,
        total_schools
    from SNOWFLAKE_LEARNING_DB.workshop_gold.gold_community_analytics
    where community_area_name is not null
),

-- Step 2: Create safety and business categories
safety_analysis as (
    select

        community_area_number,
        per_capita_income,

        total_crime_incidents,
        avg_school_safety_score,
        avg_list_price,
        avg_sold_price,
        total_schools,

            when avg_school_safety_score >= 60 then 'Safe Schools'
            when avg_school_safety_score >= 40 then 'Moderate Safety'
            when avg_school_safety_score >= 20 then 'Low Safety'

        -- Income categories
        case 
            when per_capita_income > 50000 then 'High Income'
            when per_capita_income > 30000 then 'Medium Income'
            else 'Low Income'
        end as income_category,
        
        -- Property value categories
        case 
            when avg_list_price > 500000 then 'High Value'
            when avg_list_price > 300000 then 'Medium Value'
            else 'Low Value'
        end as property_value_category
        
    from community_analytics
),

-- Step 3: Aggregate by safety categories
safety_correlations as (

        school_safety_level,
        income_category,
        property_value_category,

        avg(per_capita_income) as avg_income,
        avg(avg_list_price) as avg_property_value,
        avg(avg_school_safety_score) as avg_school_safety,
        avg(total_crime_incidents) as avg_crime_incidents
    from safety_analysis
    group by crime_level, school_safety_level, income_category, property_value_category
)

-- Final analysis results
